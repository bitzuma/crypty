#Crypty

Simplified elliptic curve cryptography for the browser.

Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has numerous uses - from digital rights management to Bitcoin. Many JavaScript ECC libraries have been written, and some of them are quite good. If you're building an application that needs ECC, use one of them.

Learning how ECC works is a different matter. Instead of efficient, veratile code, you want well-documented, simple code. This is where Crypty comes in.

Crypty translates the core ECC functionality into a minimal, dependency-free JavaScript library. A browser-based test suite demonstrates all of the main concepts.
